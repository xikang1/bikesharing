## Overview
In this project, we analyzed the Citi Bike data in August 2019 to show the data visualization to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business idea. I have included the Citi Bike data summary, analysis of checkout time and trips with different conditions in the link here:

I will explain all the data details in the report.

## Results
By clicking the link I provided in the overview, you can easily find the data visualization using Tableau about Citi Bike data summary. On the page of "NYC Citi Biking", you can understand Citi Bike-sharing program's overview. From the top graph, we can tell that young people can have more trip duration by biking than older people, the trip duration increases as younger the bikers. Most importantly, based on the graph we have for top starting and ending locations, we could pay more attention to the places where the circles' bigger sized. There is more business potential.

Let's move on to the second page, "Checkout time". This data has indicated how long would people do biking. Most of the biker do biking for about half an hour. Among these bikers, there are about four times of male bikers (about 80K) compared with female bikers(about 20k). From that, I would suggest adding more male features could lead to the success of the bike-sharing program since over 80% of users are male.

On the last page named "Trips", you could have an overview of trips happened by weekdays, gender and both of them separately. For the trips by weekdays, most trips occurred from 5PM to 7PM in the weekdays and from 10AM to 6 PM for Saturday, which is not surprised. As for the gender, there are obviously more male riders are willing to do biking than female riders through almost all time period. The male subscribers play the dominent role in using Citi bike-sharing program in NYC for the user type.

## Summary
Overall, the bike-sharing program is portable in Des Moines based on our data analysis. As we know, most biking people are male, and they would do the biking from 5PM to 7PM and almost all day on Saturdays. We could settle more bikes in places where many people are willing to use the shared bikes. The average trip time duration is about 30 minutes which means we do not need to spend a lot of money on maintenance. Since more people are willing to be the subscriber, there is still a lot of potential behind this bike-sharing business.

Besides, I would like to analyze how many people are biking as little groups. If 2 to 3 people are biking together as a group, we could provide some energy drinks sales machine in the most popular bike spot to increase revenue. I will also analyse the start and end locations if the popular start and end locations are the homes and workplaces to explore more potential by setting more bike collection spots near big companies.
